# Frontend-Next.js-and-Typescript Sample Code 

This sample page has grown in scope. Originally this proejct's purpose was to simple help me and those who are trying to understand how Pagination works and limiting pages according to the amount of items user allows. 
For example we want a page to become two pages after 10 items. Through the use of Pagination page 1 of 2 will have 10 items while page 2 of 2 will have the remaining amount (x >= 10).

As mentioned this project has grown a little bit more. Now I have implemented the use of multi-selection, deletion of sensitive items, and the combination of both, multi-deletion. So, users are now allowed to select multiple items (no pagination for clarity of each component) and delete how ever many items are in play. 
Note: You can delete every dummy company but its is not permanent. Meaning that if you refreash the page everything deleted will return. 





Was AI used? Yes, specifically AI was used to make the TypeScript app page.tsx. Also in the dummy companies that were used for this project, as well as some minor visual changes. For instance the seperation of both components, I did not think about doing that the AI did and to be honest I thought this was a better route to show the use of both components.

The core of the project should be the components needed to accomplish the tasks those are a combination of AI and I. Ai helped me understand the why, while I rewrote a the function to provide more comments to explain what each important section does.
